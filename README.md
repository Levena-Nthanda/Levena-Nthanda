### 🚀 About Me
- 👩‍🎓 Recent graduate from The University of Malawi
- 🔭 I’m currently working towards publication of my undergrad research and enhancing my data analysis skills (SQL and Python) through an online Cisco course amid job search and grad school applications.
- 🌱 Academic Interests: Econometrics, Stata, R, Data Viz, Turning messy datasets into meaningful stories
- 📚 Outside of research, I am an avid reader of fantasy and literary fiction, a crocheter, a hiker, and I'm teaching myself guitar (so my  neighbours are learning patience).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data driven reserach projects in economics, public policy and health analytics
- 📫 How to reach me: I am active on LinkedIn @ linkedin.com/in/levena-banda
